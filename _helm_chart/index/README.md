# Step-by-Step Guide to Create a New Version of a Helm Index

## Build Dependencies
If your Helm chart has dependencies, make sure to run:

```bash
helm dependency build
```
> It is not necessary to include dependencies in the repository, as they will be fetched automatically from their sources.

# Update Your Helm Chart
Modify the Chart.yaml file in your chartâ€™s directory, updating the version field to reflect the new chart version.

Run the Helm command to package the chart with the updated version:
```bash
helm package ../chart
```
> This command will generate a package named mercator-<version>.tgz in the current directory.


## Create or Update index.yaml
Use the following command to create or update index.yaml. Ensure that you specify the correct URL for your repository:

```bash
helm repo index . --url https://dbarzin.github.io/mercator/_helm_chart/index
```
This command will generate or update the index.yaml file in the current directory to include the new chart version metadata.
